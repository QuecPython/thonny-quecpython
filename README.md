now, we just assume you want to install thonny(with Quecpython Kits) on your own python environment(maybe a new virtual environment or a existed one).

if you want to make a new one, you need to run below two steps:

1. make new python virtual environment.

   > shell: `python -m venv {virtual_environment_install_path}`

2. activate your the virtual environment.

   > windows:  `{virtual_environment_install_path}\Scripts\activate`.
   >
   > macos or unix:  `source {virtual_environment_install_path}/bin/activate` .

else you just need to do:

3. install

    > shell: `pip install -i {pypi_site_url} thonny-quecpython`
    >
    > here is some web site for pypi download below, you can choose one.
    >
    > | pypi_site_url                             |
